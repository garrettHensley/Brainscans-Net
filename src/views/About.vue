        Brainscans.net is an inclusive competitive organization. We believe
        everyone should have a chance in competing in esports regardless of
        influencer-status. Since our launch, we’ve always strived to stay away
        from invite-only event, and opened our registrations for the masses.

        Brainscans has been a powerful force in Valve’s Artifact, kicking off
        with the first publicly available tournament- Beta Bonanza. Following
        that, with it’s Launch Day Tournament, to great success with high player
        count, and high viewership on Twitch. For months following Launch Day
        Tournament, Brainscans continued to host standalone tournaments along
        with a ‘Friday Night Magic’ style online league.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Brainscans hopped out of the tournament scene following Artifacts
        infamous ‘Long Haul’ blogpost. In the meantime starting a Dota
        Underlords offshoot, known as Underlords Pro which is still hosting
        tournaments to this day.

        beyond. Stay tuned for more information, to see how you can participate.
